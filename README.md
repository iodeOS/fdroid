# iodéOS f-droid repository

This repository contains some of the apps embedded in the
[iodéOS](https://gitlab.com/iode/ota/) operating system.

**All these apps are sligthly modified versions** w.r.t. to the original ones,
even if we sometimes kept the same package ID to avoid inconvenience iodéOS
users with apps that we forked after being first included in iodéOS in their
original versions.

Unless you know what you are doing, **prefer using the original versions**
which can be downloaded from their upstream repo or through the original
[f-droid app](https://f-droid.org/).

Our modifications of the apps source code can be found
[here](https://gitlab.com/iode/os/apps).
